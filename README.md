# React Newsfeed

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexlitel/react-newsfeed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexlitel/react-newsfeed)

This is a simple sample newsfeed-based React site, and a frontend test/demonstration project I made with some identifying details removed. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). A number of packages have been added to the Create React App configuration to enable routing, Sass-esque code in CSS, and Enzyme testing, among other things. The store may not persist between page changes.


Commands to get started. First four commands taken from Create React App README.
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode, or just launches test runner in CI environment.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


### `npm run lint`

Lints the app and applies any automatic fixes that eslint is able to fix on its own.
